                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is William Ruback. <br><br> I am currently learning full stack web development thanks to the UCF Coding Bootcamp program. I am becoming proficient in the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the use of front-end web development, and will soon be learning server backend as well. <br><br> In addition, I am also proficient in designing motion graphics and visuals effects with after effects, 3D work with blender, and photo editing with Adobe Photoshop. I also have video editing experience using Adobe Premerie Pro, and additional experience working on professional sets as a grip. <br><br> Below are some examples of my web development work. More will be coming soon!</p>
